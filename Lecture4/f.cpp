// Problem F: 105808. Birthday party!
// Today is Aksunkarâ€™s birthday! Aksunkar has a box. She wants to put balls in a box. Help her write a program that determines if a given point falls into this field (rectangle). The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes.

// Input format
// First, the coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle are entered from the keyboard, then the lower right and, at the end, the coordinates of the point.

// Output format
// All coordinates are integers modulo not exceeding 10000. The program should print the word yes if the point is inside the rectangle (the boundaries are counted), and no otherwise
